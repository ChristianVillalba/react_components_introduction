## Description
React Components allow us to split up large files or a complex web structure         
into smaller components AND reuse these components.

### Basic Componenct Creation:

React: Best Practice Documentation:     
[Airbnb React / JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)       

eg: Heading Component       
And all of our components will be separated into individual files with the JSX extension.       
Eg: Heading.jsx (in react_components_introduction/src/components/)        
We have to use the ES6 import / export functionality into each individual component.
